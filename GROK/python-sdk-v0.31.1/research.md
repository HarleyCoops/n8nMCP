# Groq Python SDK v0.31.1 Upgrade Plan

## Objective
Evaluate the Groq Python SDK v0.31.1 release, catalog breaking/major changes, and define an adoption testing strategy for our services and tutorials.

## Key Questions
- What new features, bug fixes, or deprecations ship with v0.31.1?
- Are there code changes required in existing MCP connectors or tutorials?
- How does the new version impact dependency constraints (Python minimum version, transitive libs)?
- What regression tests should we prioritize after upgrading?

## Research Sources
- Groq Python SDK release notes (GitHub releases, PyPI changelog).
- Commit diff between v0.31.0 and v0.31.1 tags.
- Internal usage analytics highlighting which SDK features we rely on most.

## Upgrade Steps
1. **Change Log Review**
   - Summarize major entries and categorize (feature, fix, breaking).
   - Flag items that require documentation updates.
2. **Compatibility Audit**
   - Run `pip install groq==0.31.1` inside a clean virtual environment.
   - Execute our existing unit/integration test suite against the new version.
3. **Code Updates**
   - Patch API calls if signatures changed.
   - Update tutorial snippets to reference new helper methods or parameters.
4. **Release Communication**
   - Draft internal announcement with upgrade timeline and rollback plan.
   - Update dependency pinning guidelines in our MCP templates.

## Expected Artifacts
- Release summary memo.
- Test run logs and coverage deltas.
- PRs or patches applied to dependent repositories.
