# GROK Research Pipeline

This pipeline organizes the work required to research and prepare demonstrations for the most recent Groq ecosystem updates. Each stage contains guidance on where to gather information, how to validate it, and what deliverables the team should produce to be demo-ready.

## Structure

- `remote-mcp-on-8-models/` – Explore Groq's remote MCP support across eight available models and document how to enable each one inside our stack.
- `mcp-tutorials-api-cookbook/` – Build seven MCP tutorials modeled after the Groq API Cookbook.
- `compound-ga/` – Capture what changed as Compound moved from beta to general availability and produce an adoption checklist.
- `python-sdk-v0.31.1/` – Summarize what's new in the Groq Python SDK v0.31.1 and outline upgrade testing.
- `groq-os-templates-live/` – Track the "Build with Groq OS" template launch and provide demo runbooks.

Each folder contains a `research.md` file that lists:

1. Key questions to answer.
2. Primary documentation sources to review.
3. Validation or demo steps to run locally.
4. Expected artifacts (notes, sample configs, recordings).

Use the checklists to ensure coverage before presenting findings.
