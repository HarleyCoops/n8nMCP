# MCP Tutorials for the Groq API Cookbook

## Objective
Design seven hands-on tutorials that showcase MCP integrations using the Groq API Cookbook patterns. Ensure each tutorial has runnable code snippets, reference data, and a demo narrative.

## Key Questions
- Which recipes in the Groq API Cookbook map cleanly to MCP use cases (chat, embeddings, structured output, tool calling, etc.)?
- What is the minimum MCP client setup required for each tutorial?
- How should we version tutorials as the Cookbook evolves?
- What metrics should we capture to demonstrate Groq's latency advantage?

## Research Sources
- Groq API Cookbook GitHub repository and documentation.
- Groq developer blog posts or webinars covering Cookbook releases.
- Existing MCP tutorial repositories for inspiration on structure.

## Tutorial Planning
1. **Curriculum Outline**
   - Draft seven modules covering: quickstart, streaming chat, structured JSON output, function calling, embeddings + vector search, hybrid retrieval, and evaluation/testing.
   - For each module, define learning objectives and prerequisites.
2. **Asset Inventory**
   - Collect sample prompts, dataset snippets, and API payload templates from the Cookbook.
   - Identify reusable helper scripts (authentication, logging).
3. **Implementation Guide**
   - Specify folder layout for tutorials (`/tutorial-N-name` with `README`, `notebook`, `demo-assets`).
   - Outline automation to validate that code snippets stay in sync with SDK changes.
4. **Demo Enablement**
   - Provide presenter notes and timing cues for a 30-minute workshop.
   - Recommend instrumentation (e.g., capturing request latency via MCP client hooks).

## Expected Artifacts
- Curriculum outline document.
- Tutorial folders with draft READMEs and code stubs.
- QA checklist ensuring parity between cookbook recipes and tutorials.
