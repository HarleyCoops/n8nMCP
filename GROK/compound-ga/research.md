# Compound General Availability Launch

## Objective
Understand Compound's transition from beta to general availability (GA) within the Groq ecosystem. Produce an adoption playbook covering pricing, SLAs, and integration steps.

## Key Questions
- What feature additions or breaking changes accompanied GA?
- What SLAs, quotas, or pricing tiers apply at GA?
- Are there migration steps required for beta users (API endpoints, payload changes, etc.)?
- Which customer stories or benchmarks best illustrate GA readiness?

## Research Sources
- Official Groq release notes and blog post announcing Compound GA.
- Pricing and SLA documentation from the Groq console.
- Recorded launch event or webinar sessions.
- Feedback threads from beta participants.

## Adoption Checklist
1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare beta vs GA API behavior and update our integration tests.
   - Identify deprecations or new configuration toggles.
2. **Operational Readiness**
   - Confirm monitoring hooks (metrics, logs) for Compound endpoints.
   - Review security requirements (data residency, compliance updates).
3. **Enablement Materials**
   - Draft customer-facing summary slide deck.
   - Prepare FAQ and troubleshooting guide based on beta learnings.
4. **Demo Script**
   - Build a reference workflow highlighting GA-only features.
   - Capture performance metrics before/after GA release.

## Expected Artifacts
- Migration checklist document.
- Updated integration test plan.
- Demo workflow configuration and supporting slides.
